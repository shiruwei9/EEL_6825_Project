## Description
We finish **all** functionality of Project4 Part I requirements.

#### Running options 

There 2 files we provide in ./fsx
- `Server.fsx` is the server
- `Client.fsx` is the client, and can do the performace test.


## Implementation
#### Client
The major responsibility of client is to send the message string to the server, and disply the result string to the screen

#### Server
The Twitter Server we biult is basically made up by 3 Class: Tweet, User, and Twitter. 
- Tweet shows the time we sending the tweet, which comes with System time stamp
- User provides the identity of the message and the user.
- Twitter is a Singleton instance, which is consist of many HashMap, in order to speed up the search for "#" and "@"

#### for "#" and "@", HashMap to speed up
Whenever a new Tweet is published, it will be parsed. If it contains "#" or "@", it will then be add to the HashMap.

#### Connecting and disconnecting
When we checked the user is connected/ disconnected, we would update the session/ remove the upcoming update information
After disconnecting, it will no longer refresh automatically.

## Analysis
It takes long more time for the tweet sending especially with hash tag and user mentioned.

Zipf Subscribe cost 2nd most time, since it requires total 2*N subscribes operations.

Query cost the 3nd most time, since it consists of tons of string transmission.

For other operations, it just need N operations, so they don't cost as much time as previous 3 operations.
